# Garriha-Frontend
Garriha is a mobile app for booking parking spots online. It lets users create accounts, log in with email or Gmail, and view parking lists and maps. Users can see detailed parking info, book spots for specific dates and times, and use offline mode to access reservations and scan QR codes for entry without internet.
This repository contains the frontend code developed with Kotlin.
